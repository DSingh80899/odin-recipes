    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Nobody can resist these perfect pyramids of flaky pastry, stuffed with a delicious spiced potato filling! But not all samosas are created equal. Too dry, not enough filling, bad pastry, weak spicing….. So I set out to make my own, and am proud to now share with you my very own Samosa recipe – my idea of the perfect Samosa!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ajwain seeds</li>
        <li>Amchur</li>
        <li>Hing</li>
        <li>Black mustard seeds</li>
        <li>Garam Masala</li>
        <li>Cumin seeds and powder, coriander seeds and turmeric</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Green chilli</li>
        <li>Ghee or oil</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Peas</li>
        <li>Coriander/cilantro </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rough-mashed potato – Boil potatoes until tender, then use a fork to roughly mash. It’s nice to have bits of chunks in the potato for interest, rather than a soft, creamy and uniform mash;</li>
        <li>Cook spices and aromatics – A healthy dose of spices are fried up with fresh ginger and chilli which is then tossed through along the peas;</li>
        <li>Add potato – Add the mashed potato and gently but thoroughly mix through, so the flavouring fully permeates the potato; and</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander, then cool – Lastly, mix through fresh coriander, then let the filling cool completely before using.</li>
    </ol>
